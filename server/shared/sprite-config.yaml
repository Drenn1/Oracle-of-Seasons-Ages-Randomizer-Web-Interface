  # Hacks for "GfxPointer" data, needed due to the nature of certain animations
  # being changed. For example, the up/down walking animations no longer work by
  # flipping the whole sprite horizontally, they require two independant 16x16
  # sprites. While some "unflipping" was done in the randomizer base ROM, it
  # does not apply to these types of animations, so we're applying it manually
  # here.
  # The data format is a bit complicated, so some processing is done in api.js
  # to convert it to raw bytes.

  # Nayru's harp animation is normal, but her flute animation is done by singing
  # instead. Some animation hacks are needed.
  # NOTE: Normally the flute animation data provides bit 6 (0x40) in its
  # animParameter (3rd byte of an animation frame), which tells the game to cut
  # the animation short for the unassigned strange flute, at 95 frames into the
  # animation. In the process of re-jigging the animation we no longer have a
  # line corresponding to frame 95. Doesn't really matter though, since the
  # strange flute is always assigned to a companion in the randomizer. However,
  # in the case that it wasn't, the animation would go on for far too long.
